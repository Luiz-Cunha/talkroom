        <h3>1. Free Counselling Access:</h3>
        <p>At TalkRoom, we understand that mental health support should be accessible to everyone, regardless of financial constraints. Our platform provides free counseling services, ensuring that those in need can easily find and connect with a counselor who suits their needs. The process is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly, allowing clients to focus on receiving the support they need without worrying about costs.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h3>2. Student Counsellors:</h3>
        <p>Our counsellors are advanced psychology students or recent graduates eager to apply their academic knowledge in real-world settings. These students bring fresh perspectives and a strong desire to help, under the careful supervision and mentorship of licensed professionals. This ensures that while they are gaining practical experience, clients receive competent and compassionate care.</p>

        <h3>3. Supervision and Quality Assurance:</h3>
        <p>Each counsellor student is paired with a licensed psychologist who provides oversight and guidance. This mentorship ensures that the care provided is of high quality and adheres to professional standards. Supervisors review sessions, offer feedback, and assist with complex cases, ensuring a robust support system for both clients and counselors.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h3>4. Scheduling Sessions:</h3>
        <p>Clients start by registering on the TalkRoom platform, providing basic information and their specific counselling needs. Our system then matches clients with the most suitable student counsellor based on their preferences, needs, and the counsellor's area of expertise.</p>
